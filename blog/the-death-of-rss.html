            <h1>The Death of RSS: Why Your Newsletter Needs a Modern Engine</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 1.3rem; color: #4b5563;">For a long time, RSS was the backbone of the internet. But the internet has changed, and your newsletter workflow needs to change with it.</p>
        </header>

        <section>
            <p>If you’ve ever tried to set up an automated newsletter, you’ve likely run into a brick wall known as the <strong>RSS Feed</strong>. You find a website you love, you want to share their articles with your audience, but when you look for that orange RSS icon... it’s nowhere to be found.</p>

            <h2>Why RSS is Fading Away</h2>
            <p>RSS feeds are becoming a thing of the past. In the early 2000s, every website built one by default. Today, modern web builders and social-driven platforms often ignore them entirely. Many creators want to keep you on their site, so they don’t make it easy for "bots" to pull their content.</p>
            
            <p>This leaves newsletter curators in a tough spot: <strong>If there’s no RSS feed, do you have to copy and paste everything manually?</strong></p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                "The biggest hurdle to newsletter automation used to be the technical hunt for a feed URL. We decided to delete that hurdle entirely."
            </div>

            <h2>Enter the Autolett Engine</h2>
            <p>What makes Autolett so powerful is that we don’t care if a website has an RSS feed or not. We’ve developed a <strong>one-of-a-kind process</strong> for pulling articles from literally any website.</p>
            
            <p>Our custom scraping engine doesn't look for a hidden code file; it looks at the website just like a human does. It identifies the headlines, grabs the high-resolution images, and extracts the links—all from a simple URL.</p>

            <h2>Any Website. Any Article.</h2>
            <p>Because we aren't tethered to the "old way" of doing things, your sources are now infinite. Want to pull from a niche industry blog that hasn't updated its tech in a decade? <strong>It works.</strong> Want to pull from a brand-new, flashy landing page that uses the latest JavaScript? <strong>It works.</strong></p>

            <p>You simply grab the URL where the articles live, save it to your Sources tab, and Autolett turns that static page into a live, permanent feed for your newsletter.</p>

            <h2>Future-Proof Your Curation</h2>
            <p>Relying on RSS is like trying to play a Blu-ray on a VCR. It was a great standard once, but the world has moved on. By using Autolett’s URL-based sourcing, you are future-proofing your business. You’ll never have to worry about a source "breaking" just because they updated their website and forgot to fix their RSS link.</p>
            
            <p>Ready to see how easy it is to source content without the technical headache?</p>
