        <h1>The Curation Economy: How to Start a Newsletter That Makes Money (Without Writing a Word)</h1>
        <p class="intro-lead">You don't need to be Hemingway to build a media empire. You just need to be a filter.</p>
    </header>

    <section>
        <p>When most people search for <strong>"how to start a newsletter to make money,"</strong> they assume they need to be a brilliant writer. They imagine sitting in a coffee shop, crafting 2,000 words of original insight every morning.</p>
        
        <p>But the most profitable newsletters of the last decade—<em>Morning Brew, The Skimm, The Hustle</em>—weren't built on original essays. They were built on <strong>curation</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>They didn't make the news; they organized it. They saved their readers time by filtering the noise. And in the process, they built multi-million dollar businesses.</p>

        <h2>Welcome to the Curation Economy</h2>
        <p>We are living in an age of information overload. A quick Google search returns millions of results. Your potential audience is drowning in content, and they are desperate for a lifeguard.</p>
        
        <p>That is where you come in. You don't need to create the content. You just need to find the gold hidden in the dirt.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            "A DJ doesn't write the music. They curate the playlist. And they get paid to make sure the party never stops. You are the DJ of your industry."
        </div>

        <h2>Step 1: Pick a High-Value Niche</h2>
        <p>To monetize a curated newsletter, you need a specific audience. "General News" is too broad. Instead, drill down:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Instead of "Marketing,"</strong> try "AI Tools for Real Estate Agents."</li>
            <li><strong>Instead of "Finance,"</strong> try "Daily Crypto Trends for Gen Z."</li>
            <li><strong>Instead of "Health,"</strong> try "Bio-hacking for Busy Dads."</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 2: Automate the Sourcing (The Secret Weapon)</h2>
        <p>This used to be the hard part. To be a great curator, you had to read the entire internet every day. It was a full-time job.</p>
        
        <p>This is where <strong>Autolett</strong> changes the game. You can plug in the top 20 websites for your niche—blogs, news sites, even competitor pages—and let our engine fetch the content for you.</p>
        
        <p>Your job isn't to hunt; it's to select. You look at the list Autolett generates, pick the top 5 stories, place them in your custom newsletter template, and hit send. What used to take 6 hours now takes 3 minutes.</p>

        <h2>Step 3: How to Monetize</h2>
        <p>Once you have a list of subscribers who trust your taste, the money follows. Here are the three main ways curators get paid:</p>
        
        <h3>1. Sponsorships</h3>
        <p>Brands love curated newsletters because they know exactly who is reading. If you curate "AI Tools for Real Estate," every software company in that space will pay to be in your email.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Affiliate Links</h3>
        <p>Did you share an article about a new software tool? Use an affiliate link. When your readers click and buy, you get paid. You are monetizing other people's products just by pointing to them.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Paid Subscriptions</h3>
        <p>Once you prove your value, you can put your best content behind a paywall. "The Free edition gets 5 links. The Pro edition gets the deep-dive analysis."</p>

        <h2>Start Your Empire Today</h2>
        <p>The barrier to entry has never been lower. You don't need to be a writer. You don't need to be an expert. You just need to be the person who saves your audience time.</p>
        
        <p>Autolett handles the heavy lifting of finding the content. You handle the bank account.</p>
